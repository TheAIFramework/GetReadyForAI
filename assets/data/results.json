What we can establish based on your test answers is that your organization might have a weak link in: <br/>AI Strategy <br/>Innovation projects, and AI projects in particular, have the most impact when they are aligned with one's core business objectives. Organizations oftentimes stumble at this first step by not making objectives explicitly measurable. Before projects are even started, one should be able to clearly quantify the required development resources and final deliverables. The required resources are not a function of development hours, but rather how much budget are you able to allocate to new business development. The final deliverables are business KPIs such as NSAT scores, not AI model accuracy scores. The resulting AI strategy needs to be well understood and supported by executive management if indeed the aim is to improve core services and products. Finally, this strategy needs to be communicated so that employees have a more complete context and can steer their work toward the same organizational objectives.\\n \\nAlthough each organization is unique, there are a plethora of best practices when it comes to setting up an AI Strategy that leads to results. If you're looking for more immediate detailed guidance, feel free to reach out to us at The AI Framework and Peltarion. Until then we will be compiling your results with other test-takers as detailed below."

What we can establish based on your test answers is that your organization might have a weak link in: <br/>AI Tactics <br/>When it comes implementing AI in a scalable and reliably way, there is much to be gained in adopting the well proven methods of traditional software engineering. The reason for adopting these principles is two-fold: speed and efficiency. Of the two, speed is more important, and by that we mean that one should be able to quickly start new projects, validate ideas, and go to production. The developer experience must be excellent, which is also very important in attracting new talent. When it comes to efficiency, the goal is to scale AI projects both across the organization and across your ambitions. In other words, you should not have to double your personnell just to double the number of AI projects you work on. Finally, when it comes to proper AI systems architecture, the name of the game is to design everything with a service lifetime in mind - this means everything from the data, data-features, AI models, deployed services, and to the supporting tech-stack itself. <br/>Although each organization is unique, there are a plethora of best practices when it comes to setting up AI Tactics that lead to results.

What we can establish based on your test answers is that your organization might have a weak link in: <br/>Data Management <br/>When it comes to AI-driven decision making, data needs to be treated as more than just a coincidental by-product of operations. Many organizations have 'lots of data' but it's not necessarily relevant or collected with the intent of automating business critical decisions. When AI decisions affect the business model, data can even be brought into balance sheets as an immaterial asset with real monetary value. Naturally, one manages a valuable data asset just like any other asset - by tracking the depreciation of old data, the supply(chain) of new data, and perhaps most importantly access to data resources using appropriate tools. This is what will enable your business and software developers to refine data-ore into data-gold. <br/>Although each organization is unique, there are a plethora of best practices when it comes to Data Management that leads to results.

As it currently stands, some of the most sophisticated AI systems are only available to organizations with Fortune 100 level research budgets and the gap between the haves and the have-nots is widening. Organizations that work dilligently to stay up to date on modern neural network architectures, computer hardware acceleration, and infrastructure design will have the same sorts advantages that retailers who were savvy to the Internet had in the early 2000s. The difference is that now, the Cloud allows even small startups to quickly scale their operations globally. <br/>Although each organization is unique, there are a plethora of best practices when it comes to setting up AI Technology that leads to results.

When it comes to sourcing AI talent, nothing beats proof of historical succes. Everything else, including academic degrees, experience with some software, and other 'keywords' are near useless indicators of future success. But it's not enough to know what to look for. An organization needs to be both attractive, and poised to practically enable the sort of talent they're looking for.

Roles such as evangelists and ethics experts become important spokespersons both within the company, and even more so outside the company. It is well known that customers do more business with companies that they feel are positive and ethical. Given that AI is such a rapidly moving field of science, a lot of world-class talent is found outside of incumbent 'blue chip' and management consulting firms. As such, a common practice at organizations with large research budgets is to actively blend external resources with their own as a way of both extending and upskilling their staff. <br/>Although each organization is unique, there are a plethora of best practices when it comes to Cross-Functional Abilities that lead to results.
