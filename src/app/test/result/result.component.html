    <p>The results will be gathered, analyzed and provided to you in the AI Maturity Report by The AI Framework and Peltarion, in which we will take a holistic approach to AI
      maturity and go through each vital dimension in depth. In addition to the gathered insights from this survey, the report will also be based on case studies and weâ€™ll
      identify where and how businesses tend to fail and how to best avoid and overcome those obstacles. It will help you deepen the knowledge in how your organization can
      succeed with AI and foresee many of the pitfalls other businesses tend to fall into along their AI journey. Furthermore, we will provide the progress in your specific
      industry and allow you to benchmark how your specific level of AI maturity stands relative to industry averages. The report will consequently equip businesses with an AI
      framework highlighting what enterprises need to do in order to efficiently evolve in their AI maturity and ultimately succeed in reaching their AI vision.</p>
    <p>The report will be presented to you at an event after summer and invitations will be sent out via e-mail. You will also receive the full report after the event if you
      have participated in this survey.</p>
